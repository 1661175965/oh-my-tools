Freeware by Uwe Sieber - www.uwe-sieber.de

Usage:

RunAsSystem [-min|-max|-normal|-noact|-hid] [-low|-below|-normal|-above|-high] "executable" [params for executable]

RunAsSystem waits for the started process to end and then passes its return code (aka errorlevel).

Both can be overruled by commandline params:
